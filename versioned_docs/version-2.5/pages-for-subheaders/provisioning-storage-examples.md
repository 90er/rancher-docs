Rancher supports persistent storage with a variety of volume plugins. However, before you use any of these plugins to bind persistent storage to your workloads, you have to configure the storage itself, whether its a cloud-based solution from a service-provider or an on-prem solution that you manage yourself.

For your convenience, Rancher offers documentation on how to configure some of the popular storage methods:

- [NFS](../how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/manage-clusters/create-kubernetes-persistent-storage/provisioning-storage-examples/nfs-storage.md)
- [vSphere](../how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/manage-clusters/create-kubernetes-persistent-storage/provisioning-storage-examples/vsphere-storage.md)
- [EBS](../how-to-guides/advanced-user-guides/manage-clusters/create-kubernetes-persistent-storage/provisioning-storage-examples/persistent-storage-in-amazon-ebs.md)
