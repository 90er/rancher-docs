  "description": "Fleet is GitOps at scale. Fleet is designed to manage up to a million clusters. It's also lightweight enough that it works great for a single cluster too, but it really shines when you get to a large scale. By large scale we mean either a lot of clusters, a lot of deployments, or a lot of teams in a single organization.",
