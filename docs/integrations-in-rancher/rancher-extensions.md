title: Rancher Extensions
---

New in Rancher v2.7.0, Rancher introduces **extensions**. Extensions allow admins to make changes and create enhancements to their UI functionality independent of Rancher Manager releases.

### Installing Extensions with Rancher

The  Helm Chart is used to manage access to the NeuVector UI in Rancher where users can navigate directly to deploy and manage their NeuVector clusters.

**To navigate to and install the Extensions chart:**

1. Click **â˜° > Extensions** under **Configuration**.

1. If not already installed in **Apps & Marketplace**, you must enable the extension operator by clicking on **Enable** here:

    ![Enable extensions](/img/enable-extensions.png)

   Click **OK** to add the Rancher extension repository if your installation is not air-gapped. Otherwise, click **Cancel**.
